## Introduction

Sign Bridge is an interactive Python application that focuses on helping users learn and practice American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets. It offers various modules that cater to different learning and practicing needs. Here's a brief overview of each module:

### Home Screen

The application starts with a home screen that provides options to access different modules.

### Multiple Choice

A quiz module where users are presented with images of ASL signs for alphabets and must choose the correct alphabet from multiple choices.

### Learn Alphabets

A module that allows users to learn ASL alphabets through images and descriptions.

### Webcam Quiz

An interactive quiz that uses a webcam to recognize ASL signs made by the user and provides instant feedback on correctness.

### Sign to Text

A feature that translates ASL signs captured through a webcam into text.

### Text to Sign

A feature that translates text input into ASL signs, which can be displayed on the screen.

## Dependencies

The Sign Bridge application relies on several Python libraries and frameworks. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:

- PIL (Python Imaging Library): For working with images.
- os: For file and directory operations.
- random: For generating random choices in quizzes.
- tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- pickle: For serialization and deserialization of Python objects.
- cv2 (OpenCV): For computer vision tasks and webcam access.
- mediapipe: For hand tracking and recognition.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks like training a random forest classifier.
- numpy: For numerical operations.

You can usually install these libraries using pip, for example:

```shell
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
